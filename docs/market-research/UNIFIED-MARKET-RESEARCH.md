## üìã Validation Framework

### Phase 1: Problem Discovery (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Confirm the problem exists and is painful enough

#### Interview Questions:
1. **Current State**:
   - "How do you currently manage AWS costs?"
   - "How much time do you spend monthly on cost optimisation?"
   - "What's your biggest challenge with cloud cost management?"

2. **Pain Points**:
   - "Tell me about the last time you had an unexpectedly high AWS bill"
   - "How do you identify unused resources?"
   - "What happens when you find waste? How do you clean it up?"

3. **Impact Assessment**:
   - "How much do you estimate you're wasting on unused AWS resources?"
   - "What would saving ¬£500/month mean for your business?"
   - "Who gets blamed when cloud costs are too high?"

#### Success Metrics:
- [ ] 15+ interviews completed
- [ ] 80%+ confirm manual cost optimisation takes 2+ hours/month
- [ ] 70%+ estimate 10%+ waste in their AWS spend
- [ ] 60%+ express frustration with current tools/processes

### Phase 2: Solution Validation (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Validate our proposed solution resonates

#### Demo Script:
```
"Imagine a tool that:
1. Scans your AWS account in 2 minutes
2. Identifies ¬£500+ in monthly waste
3. Shows you exactly what's safe to delete
4. Can automatically clean up with your approval

Would this solve your problem?"
```

#### Interview Questions:
1. **Solution Fit**:
   - "What would you expect this tool to cost?"
   - "How would you prefer to use it - web dashboard or command line?"
   - "What would make you trust it with your AWS account?"

2. **Buying Process**:
   - "Who would need to approve purchasing this tool?"
   - "What's your typical process for buying new software?"
   - "What would convince you to switch from your current approach?"

3. **Feature Priorities**:
   - "What AWS resources would you want scanned first?"
   - "How important is automated cleanup vs just identification?"
   - "What reporting would you need?"

#### Success Metrics:
- [ ] 15+ solution validation interviews
- [ ] 70%+ say they would use this tool
- [ ] 50%+ willing to pay ¬£49-99/month
- [ ] 30%+ willing to commit to early access

### Phase 3: Purchase Intent (Week 5-6)
**Goal**: Get concrete commitments and pre-orders

#### Offer Structure:
- **Early Bird Special**: 50% off first 6 months
- **Beta Access**: Free 30-day trial + priority support
- **Money-Back Guarantee**: Full refund if no savings found

#### Commitment Questions:
1. **Purchase Intent**:
   - "If I could deliver this in 4 weeks, would you buy it?"
   - "What would need to be true for you to purchase on launch day?"
   - "Can I put you down for early access at ¬£49/month?"

2. **Reference Validation**:
   - "Would you be willing to be a case study customer?"
   - "Could I use your company as a reference for other prospects?"
   - "Would you provide a testimonial if the tool saves you money?"

#### Success Metrics:

## üéØ Customer Interview Scripts

### Opening (Problem Discovery)
```
"Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time to chat. I'm researching how companies manage their AWS costs and wondering if you could share your experience.

First, could you tell me a bit about your role and how you interact with AWS?"

[Listen for role, responsibilities, AWS usage]

"How do you currently handle cost optimisation for your AWS infrastructure?"

[Listen for current process, tools, frequency]
```

### Problem Deep Dive
```
"That's interesting. Can you walk me through what happened the last time you had to investigate high AWS costs?"

[Listen for specific pain points, time investment, frustration]

"How much time would you say you spend monthly on cost-related activities?"

[Listen for time investment, opportunity cost]

"If you had to estimate, what percentage of your AWS spend do you think is on unused or underutilised resources?"

[Listen for waste estimates, specific examples]
```

### Solution Introduction
```
"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like there's a real challenge here. I'm working on a tool that automatically scans AWS accounts to identify waste and can safely clean it up.

Imagine if you could run a command that:
- Scans your entire AWS account in under 5 minutes
- Identifies specific unused resources costing you money
- Shows you exactly how much you'd save by removing them
- Can automatically clean them up with your approval

How would something like that fit into your workflow?"

[Listen for interest level, concerns, questions]
```

### Pricing Discovery
```
"If a tool like this could save you ¬£500 per month reliably, what would you expect to pay for it?"

[Listen for price anchoring, budget constraints]

"How does your company typically evaluate and purchase new software tools?"

[Listen for buying process, decision makers, approval requirements]
```

### Closing & Commitment
```
"This has been really helpful. Based on our conversation, it sounds like this could be valuable for your team.

I'm planning to have a working version ready in about 4 weeks. Would you be interested in being one of the first to try it out?"

[Listen for commitment level]

"I'm offering early access customers a 50% discount for the first 6 months. If the tool works as described, would you be willing to commit to trying it at ¬£49/month?"

[Listen for purchase intent, objections]
```
